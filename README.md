# Unlocking-the-Art-of-Writing
This project fulfills the requirements for the final project of DSCI-6602 Introduction to Data Science, instructed by Professor Sula Ardiana, as part of the Master's in Data Science program at the University of New Haven. The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality)

# Writing Process Analysis User Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the Writing Process Analysis project! This project aims to analyze the writing process using a large dataset of writing logs. The goal is to uncover key aspects of the writing process that may influence the quality of written work.

## Project Structure

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: The core of the project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, written in Python. The notebook includes data processing, feature extraction, model training, and predictions for test data. The notebook is well-commented to help understand each step of the process.

2. **Project Deployed using Django Webserver in Azure**: The Project is hosted [here.](https://team-2-dsci-6002-f23-fp-unlocking-the-art-of-writing.azurewebsites.net/)


## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: The code is written in Python 3.9.0. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook using the command `pip install notebook`.
- **Required Python Packages**: Install the necessary packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/CRLannister/Unlocking-the-Art-of-Writing.git"
   cd "Unlocking-the-Art-of-Writing"
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Writing_Process_Analysis.ipynb`) in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter, VSCode with Jupyter extension).

4. **Execute Cells**: Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. Make sure to check for any variable or file path adjustments if needed.

5. **Review Outputs**: The notebook generates various outputs, including visualizations, performance metrics, and a submission file (`submission.csv`).
